In this portfolio, I share my journey in data analysis and programming. Here, youâ€™ll find projects that showcase how I work with various datasets, automate tasks, and uncover insights using tools like Python, Power BI, and SQL.

## Featured Projects

### 1. Cleaning Data with Regular Expressions
In this project, I demonstrate how to clean and preprocess data using Python's regular expressions. I show techniques for handling messy data, removing unwanted characters, standardizing formats, and preparing the data for analysis.

### 2. Creating Fake Data with Python
This project showcases the creation of **synthetic/fake data** using the **Faker** library in Python. It demonstrates how to generate realistic datasets for testing or simulations, including personal details, company information, and more. The generated data can be customized and exported for further use.

### 3. Tesla Stocks and Financial Data with yfinance
In this project, I use the **yfinance** library to fetch and analyze Tesla's stock prices and financial data. The notebook covers how to retrieve historical stock prices, financial statements. This project demonstrates how to leverage Python for stock market analysis and financial insights.

### 4. Cleaning and Formatting Data with Python
In this project, I showcase how to clean and format data using Python's **pandas** library. The notebook addresses common issues  incorrect data types, null values , text inconsistencies, and duplicates. 

### 5. SQL Data Cleaning and Formatting
This project involved cleaning and formatting a dataset by standardizing data types and replacing null values, ensuring data integrity for subsequent analysis.

### 6. SQL KPI Analysis 
In this project, I calculated key performance indicators (KPIs) from a cleaned dataset, providing valuable insights for performance evaluation and data-driven decision-making.

### 7. Power BI Dashboard: Interactive Visualization of IMDB Ratings
- Dashboard 1: Ratings and Genre insights for understanding popularity and rating trends by genre.
- Dashboard 2: Financial insights into gross revenue, its trends, and correlations with ratings.
- Dashboard 3: People-focused insights, showing top contributors (directors and actors) and offering detailed movie information.
### 8. Power BI Dashboard: Interactive Visualization of FAANG stocks 
This dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of key financial metrics for **Amazon**, **Netflix**, **Google**,**Apple**and **Facebook** from **2019 to 2024**. It includes:

- **Trading Volume Trends**: Visualizations that highlight trading activity and identify high and low periods.
- **Close and Open Variations**: Charts illustrating daily price fluctuations and overall market volatility.
- **Closing Price vs. Moving Averages**: A comparison of closing prices with 20- and 12-day moving averages to uncover market trends.

This tool is designed for tracking performance and making data-driven investment decisions.
### 9. Data Visualization with Python (Matplotlib)
This project analyzes a dataset of car purchases, referred to as the cars dataset, using Python's Matplotlib library to create insightful visualizations
